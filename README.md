# Surfs_Up
---
## Overview of Project
We are hoping to open up a surf shop in Oahu. Our potential investor W.Avy has asked us to perform some data analysis on the weather. Our initial findings looking at the weather throughout one year were positive and W.Avy would now like more specific analysis on the months of June and December. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to look at weather statistics for the avaliable data in the months of June and December. Here I generated summary statistics on the temperatures during the months of June and December. 

## Results
The analysis can be found in the notebook below:
