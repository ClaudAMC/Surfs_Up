# Surfs_Up
---
## Overview of Project
We are hoping to open up a surf shop in Oahu. Our potential investor W.Avy has asked us to perform some data analysis on the weather. Our initial findings looking at the weather throughout one year were positive and W.Avy would now like more specific analysis on the months of June and December. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to look at weather statistics for the avaliable data in the months of June and December. Here I generated summary statistics on the temperatures during the months of June and December. 

## Results
The analysis can be found in the notebook below:

### June Summary Statistics:
The results from the June month analysis are summarized in the image below:

### December Summary Statistics:

The results from the December month analysis are summarized in the image below:

### Results Summary:

1. From the summary statistics we can see that overall the tempature remains relatively stable between the two months with mean temparatures only varying ~3.5 degrees F. The average temperatures in June fall around 75 degrees F and in December around 71 degrees F. This is a small 4 degree difference. Additionally we know from the standard deviations that this is not a significant difference, the standard deviations are 3.26 and 3.75 degrees F respectively. This means the averages deviate less than 2 std from the mean.

2. We can also see that the temperatures in December do decrease slightly. We can see that the minimum temperature during december was 56 degrees F where as the lowest temperature in June was 64 degrees F. From this we know that although the average temperatures are not all that different there are colder days in December as opposed to June.

3. Finally, when we look at the quartiles for each data set we can see that the june temperature spread seems to be quite even as the temperature difference between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quartile is even at 2 degrees F. This is similar to the spread of the December temperatures where the difference between the 1st and 2nd quartiles is 2 degrees F and the diffrence between the 2nd and 3rd quartiles is 3 degrees F. This means the spread of temperatures is quite similar only that the overall temperaturesare lower in December compared to June (as mentioned in point 1).
